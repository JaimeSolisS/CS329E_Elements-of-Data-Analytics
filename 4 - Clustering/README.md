# Assignment 4: Clustering & Anomaly Detection

In this assignment you will explore the concepts of clustering and anomaly detection. 

For this assigment you'll be working with the Epileptic Seizure Recognition Data Set developed at Rochester Institute of Technology. In this data set each row is a sample of the EEG recording at a different point in time. The dataset contains 179 columns, the first 178 are the EEG features while the last column represents the label y {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. All subjects falling in classes 2, 3, 4, and 5 are subjects who did not have epileptic seizure. Only subjects in class 1 have epileptic seizure. The class labels will not be used for clustering (which is an unsupervised task!) - they will just be used for plotting the data. The only change that was made to the original dataset was removing the first column, which contained the row indexes.
