# Assignment 1 : Decision Tress using scikit-learn

In this assignment we'll attempt to classify patients as either having or not having diabetic retinopathy. For this task we'll be using the Diabetic Retinopathy data set, which contains 1151 instances and 20 attributes (some categorical, some continuous). You can find additional details about the dataset [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetic+Retinopathy+Debrecen+Data+Set).
