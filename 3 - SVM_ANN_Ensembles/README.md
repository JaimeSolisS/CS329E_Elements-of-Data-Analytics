# Assignment 3 : SVMs, Neural Nets, Ensembles
In this assignment you'll implement SVMs, Neural Nets, and Ensembling methods to classify patients as either having or not having diabetic retinopathy. For this task we'll be using the same Diabetic Retinopathy data set which was used in the previous assignments. You can find additional details about the dataset [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetic+Retinopathy+Debrecen+Data+Set).
